# Teniski Klub Lajkovac

This project was designed and developed by [me](https://www.lukabajic.dev).
This repository contains the back-end.

## Description

Official web application of Tennic Club Lajkovac.

Main purpose is to allow registered users to schedule a court to play.
User can also access other registered users information to get in contact with them.

Later versions will implement:

- A way to challenge and accept challenges from other users
- To keep track of the town league scores and schedules online
- A recent match history of each user individually and in total
- Ranking system
- etc.

Will develop iOS/Android app later this year.
